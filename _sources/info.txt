TODO
----
Some features I may (or may not) add to SkoolKit some day are:

* `skool2skool.py`, a utility for transforming skool files (e.g. from decimal
  to hexadecimal, or vice versa)
* The ability to label routines in an HTML disassembly, so that (for example)
  ``CALL 24993`` in Skool Daze becomes ``CALL GETRANDOM`` (still hyperlinked to
  the disassembly page for the routine at 24993)
